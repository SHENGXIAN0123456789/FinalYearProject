Instead, we want to build an experience that is memorable and unique. Our bartenders have the basics down, but are constantly on the look-out for new trends, micro-local offerings, and guests’ evolving needs. They are not just a beverage enthusiast, but also the host of the space. Their role goes beyond the bar itself to take ownership of guest service more broadly and do what needs to be done. Bartenders will use their knowledge and expertise to make the bar look and function flawlessly. They will build relationships with others across the hotel and in the community, to anticipate and deliver on our guests’ needs. They should be passionate about the guest service experience, but also have an eye for detail – from the money that moves through their hands, to the information they provide to guests, to the quality of their drinks."," ","No matter what position you are in, there are a few things that are critical to success – creating a safe workplace, following company policies and procedures, protecting company assets, maintaining confidentiality, and ensuring your uniform and personal appearance are professional. Bartenders will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended period of time) and taking a hands-on approach to their work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 25 pounds without assistance; reach overhead and below the knees, including bending, twisting, pulling, and stooping). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Bartenders – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time."," ","PREFERRED QUALIFICATION"," ","Education: High school diploma or G.E.D. equivalent."," ","Related Work Experience: At least 1 year of related work experience."," ","Supervisory Experience: No supervisory experience."," ","License or Certification: None"," ","\n","At Marriott International, we are dedicated to being an equal opportunity employer, welcoming all and providing access to opportunity.
